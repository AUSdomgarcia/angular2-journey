# Angular Tunes

An Angular 2 application that displays artists and albums.
Used to show how to use the Router to navigate between different components.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

This example is part of the **Angular 2 From The Ground Up** course by Mirko Nasato.
